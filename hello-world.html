I'm a Principal Software Engineer / Architect at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/traveloka-com">Traveloka</a>. I enjoy sharing knowledge about Software Engineering with others.</p><h2>About me</h2><p>Background in business and entrepreneurship. I am equipped with heavy technical knowledge in frontend, backend &amp; infrastructure. Because of this unique intersection between business &amp; software engineering, I can easily influence and win the trust of people from both sides.<br><br>My story began with a startup I founded to make writing more accessible and fun for everyone. Learning how to design and scale this website brought me towards a career in software engineering, a craft I truly enjoy up till this day. I was engineer #4 in Carousell (a Singapore unicorn company), built and scaled their web application from Singapore to the rest of SEA. Later on, I built from scratch high profile projects in several large companies. Currently, I am a Software Architect in Traveloka (an Indonesian unicorn) with organizational impact of 100+ engineers across multiple domains.<br><br>People who have worked with me can usually spot my passion in honing my craft. While my primary interest is in designing systems that scale, I also enjoy mentoring other engineers and helping them expand their skills.¬†<br><br>On the side, I experiment with ideas and start my own projects. Many of which mainly serve to push myself beyond what I know. I also enjoy building interesting things in the open source world. See https://github.com/geekyme for some of my contributions.<br><br>I‚Äôm always learning about design, technology, startups, and people.¬†<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/geekyme/">Connect with me</a>¬†if we have a common interest / topic to discuss about. üçª</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 1, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://agilesoftwarearchitect.com/authors/shawn-lim/" class="invert" rel="author">Shawn Lim</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"></a>View more posts about Software Engineering on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/geekyme/">my LinkedIn page</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://agilesoftwarearchitect.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
