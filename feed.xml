                <p>My name is Shawn. I'm a Principal Software Engineer / Architect at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/traveloka-com">Traveloka</a>. I enjoy sharing knowledge about Software Engineering with others.</p>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Background in business and entrepreneurship. I am equipped with heavy technical knowledge in frontend, backend &amp; infrastructure. Because of this unique intersection between business &amp; software engineering, I can easily influence and win the trust of people from both sides.<br><br>My story began with a startup I founded to make writing more accessible and fun for everyone. Learning how to design and scale this website brought me towards a career in software engineering, a craft I truly enjoy up till this day. I was engineer #4 in Carousell (a Singapore unicorn company), built and scaled their web application from Singapore to the rest of SEA. Later on, I built from scratch high profile projects in several large companies. Currently, I am a Software Architect in Traveloka (an Indonesian unicorn) with organizational impact of 100+ engineers across multiple domains.<br><br>People who have worked with me can usually spot my passion in honing my craft. While my primary interest is in designing systems that scale, I also enjoy mentoring other engineers and helping them expand their skills.¬†<br><br>On the side, I experiment with ideas and start my own projects. Many of which mainly serve to push myself beyond what I know. I also enjoy building interesting things in the open source world. See https://github.com/geekyme for some of my contributions.<br><br>I‚Äôm always learning about design, technology, startups, and people.¬†<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-lim-0a307550/">Connect with me</a>¬†if we have a common interest / topic to discuss about. üçª</p>
